## Description

Mellow is an internal Forge 1.8.9 mod for Hypixel Bedwars, allows its users to check the stats of the players in their game, without having to bother with an external overlay, proxy, or an API key.

## Usage

All settings for the mod can be configured using OneConfig (press right shift).

To **check the stats of players in your game**, type `/who` in-game, or enable Auto Who in settings

To display **help command** type `/st`

To check an **individual**'s Bedwars stats type `/bw <username>`

To add a player to your **blacklist** type `/blacklist add <username>`

To **skin denick** type `/skindenick <username>`

To use the **number denicker** add the Aurora API key, you can get a key from [here](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1244205279697174539), automatic during game, you can also manually use `/denick <finals | beds> <number>` afterwards

## Known issues

- Doesn't work on few VPN's, cant reproduce. PIA & Windscribe should work.
- Sometimes stats are failed to fetch due to ratelimits, you can either switch stats provider in settings or run `/who` again after a bit
