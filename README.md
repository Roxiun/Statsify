## Description

Statsify is an internal Forge 1.8.9 mod for Hypixel Bedwars, allows its users to check the stats of the players in their game, without having to bother with an external overlay, proxy, or an API key.


## Known issues

- Doesn't work on few VPN's, cant reproduce. PIA & Windscribe should work.
- Sometimes stats are failed to fetch due to ratelimits and it thinks people are possibly nicked, you can just run `/who` again after a bit to refetch stats.


## How-To

When you load the mod for the first time, it creates a config file in your config folder (.minecraft\config) named statsify.json.

All settings for the mod can be configured using OneConfig (press right shift).

To **check the stats of players in your game**, type `/who` in-game, or enable Auto Who in settings

The Minimum FKDR to show on `/who`, can be configured in settings

To enable / disable **stats on tablist**, check the settings

To see how to **customize the way stats show** on tablist, check the settings

To enable / disable **custom tags**, or get information about them, check the settings

To toggle **Urchin API** check the settings of the mod in OneConfig, you can also set your API key there (The key is only needed to add tags not to use Urchin - Get your API key at [discord.gg/urchin](https://discord.gg/urchin))

To check an **individual**'s bedwars stats type `/bw <username>`

To display **help command** type `/st`

To use the **number denicker** add the Aurora API key, you can get a key from [here](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1244205279697174539)

To show **other player's pings**, set the setting to Urchin, this doesn't require a key. If you want to use Polsu API you can get a key from [here](https://polsu.xyz/api/apikey)

Stats checking for classic duels is automatic, and not toggleable. Does not have any settings.
