## Description

Fontaine is an internal Forge 1.8.9 mod for Hypixel Bedwars, allows its users to check the stats of the players in their game, without having to bother with an external overlay, proxy, or an API key. 


## Known issues

- Doesn't work on few VPN's, cant reproduce. PIA & Windscribe should work.

- Failed to fetch stats for.. 500: Mostly means the account it's querying is very new, and Minecraft API cache can't return an UUID for them. Means they probably have no stats.

- Urchin is broken.


## How-To

When you load the mod for the first time, it creates a config file in your config folder (.minecraft\config) named statsify.json.

To **check the stats of players in your game**, type `/who` in-game

To set the Minimum FKDR to show on `/who`, type `/minfkdr <number>`

To enable / disable **stats on tablist**, type `/tabstats <on/off>`

To enable / disable **custom tags**, or get information about them, type `/bwtags`

To toggle **Urchin API** type `/urchin`, to set your API key type `/urchinkey` (Get your API key at [discord.gg/urchin](https://discord.gg/urchin))

To check an **individual**'s bedwars stats type `/bw <username>`

To display **help command** type `/st`

Stats checking for classic duels is automatic, and not toggleable. Does not have any settings.
